    <h3>A FAMILY-DRAMA IN THREE ACTS. - Henrik Ibsen</h3>
    <pre>

<h3>REGINA.</h3><p>[In a low voice.]</p><p>What do you want? Stop where you are. You're
    positively dripping.

<h3>ENGSTRAND.</h3>It's the Lord's own rain, my girl.</p>

<h3>REGINA.</h3><p>It's the devil's rain, _I_ say.

<h3>ENGSTRAND.</h3> Lord, how you talk, Regina. <p>[Limps a step or two forward into
    the room.]</p> It's just this as I wanted to say--</p>

<h3>REGINA.</h3><p>Don't clatter so with that foot of yours, I tell you! The young
master's asleep upstairs.

<h3>ENGSTRAND.</h3>Asleep? In the middle of the day?</p>

<h3>REGINA.</h3><p>It's no business of yours.

<h3>ENGSTRAND.</h3>I was out on the loose last night--</p> 

<h3>REGINA.</h3><p>I can quite believe that.

<h3>ENGSTRAND.</h3>Yes, we're weak vessels, we poor mortals, my girl--</p> 

<h3>REGINA.</h3><p>So it seems.

<h3>ENGSTRAND.</h3>What do you say you won't have?</p>

<h3>REGINA.</h3><p>I won't have any one find you here; so just you go about your
business.

<h3>ENGSTRAND.</h3><p>[Advances a step or two.]</p> Blest if I go before I've had
a talk with you. This afternoon I shall have finished my work at the
school house, and then I shall take to-night's boat and be off home to
the town.</p>
